## How to do the Dockerfile?
We are following some simple conventions to make the dockerfiles to look alike among them.
### Miscellaneous
1. When listing, several dependencies for instance, use one line per item, this make easier to see the diff among versions.
2. Also when listing, follow an alphabetical order if possible. This make quicker to find something specific when searching.

### Structure
1. Header:
  1. *From*: You MUST have one docker from a specified version (FROM debian:**8**), you might use **latest** version but only if you have a fixed version of the same docker. This is intended to keep at least one version tested all the time.
  2. *Maintainer*: Include a maintainer.
2. [Dependencies]:
  1. *Binary*: Install first the binary dependencies, and among them, start by the ones included in packages by the host OS. Use one line per dependency, this makes easier to see diff among versions.
  2. *Source*: After binary dependencies install the ones not available as packages or binaries and requires compilation or other process. Again, keep them in separate lines.
3. [Configuration]:
  1. At this step, change configurations, copy needed files, etc.. This usually is very project-dependent, so it might be confusing for someone outside the project, add as many comments as posible to make it clear.
4. [Clean Up]:
  1. There might be dependencies only needed at compile-time, the compiler is a classic example. Remove all dependencies not needed at run-time at this step. This keep the image smaller and removing the compiler in a production system is always a good idea.
5. [Run command].
